Wizard:
In Dark Sun, magic is irrevocably linked to the environment. The casting of
magical spells and the enchantment of magical items always drows energy
directly from the living ecology in the vicinity, destroying the life
there. Wizards can choose two paths toward mastery of magical energy.
The preserver learns to tap magical energies in such a way as to minimize
or even cancel his destruction through balance and in-depth study, but his
progress as a wizard is very slow.
The defiler, on the other hand, casts magical spells without regard to the
havoc he plays upon the environment - compared to a preserver, a defiler
advances through level very quickly, but his very existence destroys the
life around him.
Illusionists, a specialized type of wizard, can progress as preservers or
defilers, as explained below.

Defiler:
[stats skipped]
Defilers are wizards who have decided to take a faster, darker approach to
mastering the use of magical spells. In the give and take of spell casting,
defilers are well versed in the taking, but give nothing in return. With
every spell cast, a defiler leeches the life-energy out of the plants and
soil around him, leaving a lifeless zone. Because of this, defilers can
only have non-good alignments.
