Although he is still not strong, he has taken up all my leisure time for the past two months, NOT just 3 days like somebody has implied. Yes, Taurus started with XYJII. He is part of my life for the past few weeks. I like putuo menpai very much and hope that I can be aputuo highhand someday. Taurus got pked for other person's wrong doing (Please don't argue with me for this since I don't want to see lies flying around. Of course, in the world of MUD, highhands don't have any wrong doings unless they can be punished).In order to revenge, Taurus had to betray to xueshan and learn to castjieti. Do you think that is an easy decision for me to make? Taurus's MUDlife was basically over and all my 240 hard working hours were gone onceTaurus became a suicide bomber. In some sense, taurus has been eliminatedby fengmi, and fengmi still lives happily -- fengmi has won the battle. Hejust has to pay the price slowly. I am sure fengmi can outlast taurus since fengmi can keep playing while taurus cannot and the chance for taurus to die is almost twice as much as fengmi's. Don't tell me that highhands' life is more precise. That is pure BS, both in MUD and in life.Highhands have enough advantages in the MUD -- they can easilykill a lowhand in one perform and/or faint him and feed him to an autokillNPC. Under the current XYJ setting, a highhand can easily ruin a lowhand's life. Jieti is the only tool that lowhands can use to fight back and thuskeep the balance between lowhands and highhands. If jieti is not there, kuer's XYJI pk era will be back very soon.I think jieti's cost is reasonable. It costs a lowhand's life and lot of fali in exchange for the chance (and just chance)  to kill a highhand. If the successfulrate is too low, jieti will not do too much damage to the highhand and the lowhand will die permanmently very fast -- jieti will become a toy cast in that case. The price is actually a little too high -- lowhand's life is over once he starts using jieti (fy's needle is a much handier tool to revenge). While jieti may pose as a threat to all highhands, no sane person will use it usless he is desperated -- Who will spend 240 true (not robot)hours to train a suicide dummy?","file_name":"/data/doc/1999/Mar/doc3.9","id":"doc",])
