What is changed?Learning speed.Before change, i could increase of 25 right-hand levelper potential.After change, I can only get 20 increase per potential.II. Reason of the changeThe old function of learning can give a negative numberper learning, which is unreasonable.III. Technical analysis of the changeOld learining function differenciate from the current oneby an additional 'learning bonus' which is random from -5to 15, with an average of 5.Negative learning is caused by the negative bonus. However,with mass learning, only the average--5, matters.IV. Consequence of the changeClearly, everyone's learning speed is slower, by an absolute of5 per potential. For a player, usually highhand and midhand, with 40 int(wuxing),The old speed is 25% faster.For a normal player, with 30 int, the old speed is 33.3% faster.For a normal newbie, with 24 int, the old speed is 42% faster.The lower the int, the more suffers.The change will not only slow down the growth of everyone, willalso increase the gap of highhand to midhand, and midhand to newbies.V. Suggestions1. Change 'learning bonus' to a 'fix bonus' which equals to the old averge --'5'. This will make the learning speed back to old, without any negative number.2. If a random variable of 'kar' is preferred, the bonus function canbe random (kar/4) which is between 2 to 7, with a slightly loweraverage of 4.5.3. Learning bonus can be a function of player's daoxing, which is very re--experienced one can learn more than a less one.The bonus function can be (year of daoxing / 50). Personally, i preferthis :). However, it also will place newer player at a disadvantage.4. No more change.Well, i can hardly comment on this. The report is done by croc.In hope to give players a more understanding of what is going on in themud. And to improve the two-way communication between players and wizs.","file_name":"/data/doc/1997/Jun/doc6.14","id":"doc",])
