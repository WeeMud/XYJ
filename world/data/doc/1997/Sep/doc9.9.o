Now a rigorous mathematical Proof that explains why thisis true:Postulate 1:  Knowledge is Power.Postulate 2:  Time is Money.As every engineer knows,       Work       ---------- = Power       Time       Since Knowledge = Power,       and Time = Money, we have       Work       ----------- = Knowledge       MoneySolving for Money, we get:         Work      ------------------- = Money       KnowledgeThus, as Knowledge approaches zero, Money approaches infinity regardless of the Work done.Conclusion:  The Less you Know, the more you Make.Note: It has been speculated that the reason why Bill Gates dropped out of Harvard's math program was because he stumbled upon this proof as an undergraduate, and dedicated the rest of his career to the pursuit of ignorance.--Of course, the corollary is that as knowledge increases, money decreases.  Those of us with many years of graduate education are approaching this limit.","file_name":"/data/doc/1997/Sep/doc9.9","id":"doc",])
