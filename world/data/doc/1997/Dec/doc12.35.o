This isnot equivalent to a true NATIVE_MODE mudlib.  File/object access runs ina compat configuration, every object is given an uid \"root\".  Thefile_name() efun has been simul_efuned to behave as in compat mode.  Allroom code (/room directory) is written in COMPAT, you will have to writeyou own room code.There are many more features, and development continues evenwithout a solid and dependable site from which to work. Overall,having worked on and run several muds, this system has beendevised so as to benefit both the players as well as all creators;(from admin to apprentice). Sorry for the lengh of document.Regards,Cokie","id":"doc","name":"文档","file_name":"/data/doc/1997/Dec/doc12.35",])
