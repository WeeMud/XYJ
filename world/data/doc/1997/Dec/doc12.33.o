You can grant anyone     read/write access to one file, a dir, or all your things!  *  Extensive documentation allows better understanding of the     lib, and the creators part in coding, from armour to     weapons, to quests and spells'n'skills.  *  There are extensive \"wiztool\" commands, too numerous to     write.  With cmds such as deltree, tree, find.  Extensive     object locating cmds.        Eg. stat users           Put users::room           dest sword 2 in bag in chest in zilanthius           find all orcs           dest all orcs (find_living usually only handles 1item)l  *  Automatic checking of objects with 'stat' (monsters, armour,     inventories, etc) with QC documentation, outlining illegal     items, and noting where changes are required.","id":"doc","name":"ÎÄµµ","file_name":"/data/doc/1997/Dec/doc12.33",])
