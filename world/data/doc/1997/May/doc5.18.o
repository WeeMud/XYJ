When reading books, it will cost you some 神，based on your wuxingand the book itself. The higher the wuxing, the lower the 神 cost.Every read you will get (literate level/5 + 1) exp. For example, if yourliterate level is 31, you can get 31/5+1=7 exp for every read.So the general point about reading books is that: first learn your literatelevel to 10 or 15. After that, you can read the 三字经 to 31 level.Then, you can either read some easy books, like spells, etc. Or read the literate level further to 51. Up to you.Easy here means the books cost 神 <= 10.The level can read is also constrained by your daoxing, as mentioned by pal.For newbies, don't be too hurried to read books. Read the literate book isenough. After that, can read some other books. The most important for newbie is fighiting and get familiar with xyj, thatis all.","name":"文档","id":"doc","file_name":"/data/doc/1997/May/doc5.18",])
