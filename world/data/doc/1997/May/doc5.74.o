They all begin on the same side. You have 17 minutes to get all of them across to the other side. It is night. There is one flashlight.  A maximum of two people can cross at one time.  Anyparty who crosses, either 1 or 2 people, must have the flashlight with them. The flashlight must be walked back and forth, it cannot be thrown, etc.  Eachwoman walks at a different speed.  A pair must walk together at the rate of theslower woman's pace.>     Woman 1:  1 minute to cross>     Woman 2:  2 minutes to cross>     Woman 3:  5 minutes to cross>     Woman 4:  10 minutes to crossFor example if Woman 1 and Woman 4 walk across first, 10 minutes have elapsedwhen they get to the other side of the bridge.  If Woman 4 then returns with theflashlight, a total of 20 minutes have passed and you have failed the mission. See how quick you can solve this!NOTES:There is not a trick behind how to accomplish this.  It is a simple movement ofresources in the appropriate order issue.  There are 2 known answers to thisproblem.  This question is asked by Microsoft interviewers to all prospectiveemployees!","name":"ΞΔµµ","id":"doc","file_name":"/data/doc/1997/May/doc5.74",])
