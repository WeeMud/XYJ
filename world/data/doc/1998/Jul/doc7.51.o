Don't you seeThere are this pair of eyesof mine, don't you seethe tears in themI wave my handsI jump, I runthe same direction.  The sky is farI don't know what to do...then I become quiet.The bird knows, knowsthe jumping kid, the running kidknows the little home for herin his heartshe sees the waving handsthe hands wavinghelplessly...but too much effort to changethe course, to the edge of the sky.that she doesn't even knowthe destination.","file_name":"/data/doc/1998/Jul/doc7.51","id":"doc",])
