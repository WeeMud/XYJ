Ofcuzthere comes some new changes accordingly. Not worth totry anything here, so I will just stop it.Before i leave, sth have to clarify again.Most of these facts were in our previous postand I wonder why those posts are especially not worthto put into stories -- too short? most of them were long.no chinese? sorry i type chinese too slow, but even those\"interesting\" long posts in chinese were not put into storieseither.1) how did we find yun == jiezhao ?Jiezhao tried to pk all the players, it is true that hecould get back some pk dx easily that way, but he did notrealized some players would keep fingering him.(I am lazy and only used eratt to keep type who -i. That'swhy jiezhao thought eratt as nail-in-eye. Once as soon as shulogged in, feng immediately went to bank to wait him. He wasnot there nor I think i met any player on the road. Result isfunny though, shu quit immediately and rumor kept slapping eratt,feng and heng*.)Mint did not post who found jiezhao 1st, now I think shu is notstrong enuf to threaten him, and wiz ... hope won't give him smallshoes only due to this ... Shaoying told mint to finger jiezhaoand we found no such player. There was no rumor saying jiezhaosuicided, so mint typed \"who -l\" and saw an strange female fangcun charcalled \"yun\", with >500 yrs dx and her title was not set.Ironically, he picked a name that was mint's old char -- never playedbut with quite good gifts chosen -- later yun's gifts was no longergood due to some major changes and she was purged due to long timeno login.Then we chatted it out, then there login another jiezhao, from finger,his last login was year 1969 sth, so it is a new char. This jiezhaosuicided once, trying to make up (too late ofcuz.)  Then joy's char chattedthat yun is an old player and not jiezhao (who believes it? -- so itis obvious yun is jiezhao, there were not other \"old player\" who wasafraid others know his old id.) A few min later, when we finger yun,no such player again. Mint asked mimi if yun is jiezhao, mimi replied\"xixi\", and we thought it is a hint.We thought the case if over, since it seemed to us that the wiz andjiezhao were \"scared\" after this (wrong!). We did not think suchan action, which was discovered by players immediately, wouldcontinue. But later this kind of action was conducted again andcharacterized as \"legal action\" in mon's post, which lookedlike the 交代 players waited for days from wizs. (Now i realize wizsneed not give any 交代 to players, they post to smash any aspects whichwill damage their image, by all means.)2) how did we find shu == jiezhao ...then that weekend, when I login, some players (whywhy and freeman ithink) asked who was shu. they checked and found this shu has dx>512,skills >190, fali>2000. They also saw shu fighting bajiao guai, laterwent to fight shuizhi jing. So i used hengha go talk to her and askedher if she was jiezhao, She refused to talk, so i killed her fightingtargets to make sure she can see my words. She claimed she was usingthis id playing from beginning. So I told her i never saw her playingbefore, and she reponded that she never saw hengha playing beforeeither and flied back to putuo.I chased to putuo, pushed her to clarify that she was not jiezhao toavoid getting pked by my mistake. I proposed that she let my dummy toapprentice her. So after a few min, she recruited my dummy. Oh, great,this shu now has best skill around 150, with only a few levels ofbuddhism, lotusforce and huoyun-qiang, with basic spells 114 sth,with basic dodge 98 (jiezhao chatted out his dodge reached 100 once,and later he died twice from NPC, nor did he had much chance tofighting after that.) -- these details were in my old posts too, ifthose posts were still there. Ofcuz major evidence is that how couldhis fali be 2000+ with that low spells level, how could his skillsbeing checked as 190+ while now none of his skills >160.That's some of the aspects i want to clarify. I heard (indirectly)that some wiz's dummy complained that why players left and still cameback \"bullshit\". I post this (possibly last) post, because I see somewiz is posting their own version of \"truth\".END","id":"doc",])
