In my opinion,he is a serious and nice mud player. I seldom saw him PK innocent player andhe often help newbie. About the robot, yes, I know him run robot, but I justdouble checked the xyj rule, it does NOT ban robot. So this is not the reasonto accuse him. About the multiple login from same IP. I have something toclarify. The accounts in 129.7.*.* are belonged to me. Because it has fast andreliable connection to internet, I lent them to some of my mud friends, whichinclude kuer, erat and xine. As far as I know, kuer is the only robot he runs.So it is not fair to accuse kuer for running multiple robots.As a kuer's friend, I think the limitation might be a good news to kuer. Heis too addict to xyj. There are much more important things then mud for him totake care. So it is my serious advice for kuer to quit xyj, at least not spendtoo much time on it. But I am afraid that kuer will just treat my words aser3 bian1 feng1.:(arwen","file_name":"/data/doc/1998/Jul/doc7.10","id":"doc",])
