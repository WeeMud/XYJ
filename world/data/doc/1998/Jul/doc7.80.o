You guys insist that either wizards orthe system wrong, or all the players except jiezhao wrong. What's the pointto get to that conclusion? As I said eveybody left in his/her own reason.Hengha and mint left because of blocking the 5th character from the same ip.Kuer left because he lost the chance to run robot from that site.Xyy left because of hengha left, pxl claimed to leave because of xyy's leaving.Fjz claimed to leave because of their leaving. Miner left because of her death.Lijing left because of the party? ( This is still a mystery to me.) Or becauseof xyy's leaving? Or because of his own reason?See how is related with jiezhao's id? I can not understand why miner has to leavleave because of her death? I would say such kind of pk happened in bj site along time ago. It happens here is just a matter of time.Come as you want to come, and leave when you ready to leave.","id":"doc",])
