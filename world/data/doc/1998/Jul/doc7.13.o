Some people even consider it a serious problem.In kuer&company's case, yes, I think it may be a little too harsh on youguys. My total regard and sympathies to you.  It may also be true that theapplications of and changes to this restriction were not communicated to theplayers in the most agreeable and efficient way. (I don't know for sure.)But hey, there ain't no free lunch, you know?  You gotta swallow somethingsince this service is otherwise totally free of charge.There must be a reason for the wizs to apply this restriction.  Myunderstanding is they do this in the hope of discouraging the use of robots and thus boosting system performance.  And what's wrong with that?  Don'tyou sometimes feel extreme lagging?  I don't know how big a role roboting playshere. But I am reasonably sure that the use of robots does take some blame.I think wizs have done a wonderful job in creating and maintaining this mudfor us to play, chat and meet new friends.  I am sure wizs are doing everythingthey can to balance the enjoyment of the majority and individual freedom.People come to this mud for all kinds of reasons.  Some are serious players,other just want to relax and chat, me being the latter.  Whatever the reason,I believe everyone would like to (not necessarily do so though) meetinteresting people and make new acquaintances.  Now I heard that Kuer is areally high-hand.  He can probably kill other players with ease andenjoyment (I hope not).  But the matter of the fact is: ever since hisannouncement a few days back, I have seen significant reduction in the numberof players.  I am even losing money on my Kezhan operation. What's more,jokingly or not, people are starting to discuss ways to avoid kuer.  Seemsto me that Kuer is seriously scaring other players away.  I just don't see this can make people like you and want to know you better.Make love, not war. :)  Peace.I don't see any correlation between the two things.  For all I care, I thinkone is just used as an excuse to the other, a lame one too.PS: One final advice, quoted from a forgotten source:Get used to it, or get lost!*nokill robodog","file_name":"/data/doc/1998/Jul/doc7.13","id":"doc",])
