As I see it, Wallace is just an ordinary people like us, he wants to live a peaceful life, but the cruel reality broke hisdream, and he realized that under such a governmentit is not possible to live a normal life so he roseup and fought like a man. Though he failed at last,this kind of spirit should be carried on through generations.Don't you think we lack brave hearts?Long live freedom.","name":"ÎÄµµ","file_name":"/data/doc/1998/Jul/doc7.107","id":"doc",])
