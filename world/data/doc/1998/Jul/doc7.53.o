I have been waiting.  She was floating in the air.  I was waiting for the wind, the wind that would bring her closer to me, the wind that would bring me up to meet her.She entered my sight and she left.  She entered my sight and she left.  Each time she was further away.  I saw another person, the person who was walking towards her.  And she smiled, she smiled at him.  Let the wind blow, in whichever direction.  a destination i had not.  i leftmy eyes on the ground.  Wind came and I took off to fly.  Freedom I had inthe sky...  With my heart I sensed a smiling face.  There she was again.","file_name":"/data/doc/1998/Jul/doc7.53","id":"doc",])
