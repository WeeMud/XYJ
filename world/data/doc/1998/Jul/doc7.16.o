In penglai, 3 xing are almost always dead (killed by highhands' robot to get fruit), make it very hard for wzg dizi to learn. I'm doinghpuptimequests so have no qn limit, so its not a very big problem (once i wasnt be able to learn anything till 2263 qn and finally found a fainted xing left on penglai.. *cry).but for those wzg dizi who fighting NPC who has 100 qn limit, this willbe a serious problem. There arent any other menpai's master wanted so bad by highhands... Therefore, my suggestion is to have another room inpenglai which will be a safe place (like kz), 3 xing will stay in there \"品香茗, 调弟子\" for the first 3-5 mins of refresh, then come out and \"give fruit\" or get killed or whatever...2. ren seng guo is good to have, but it seems theres people creating dummies and accept zhenyuan daxian then get disconnected. after 10 minsor so, they reconnect then disconnect again and again... this is a verycheap trick to throw out but it does work sometimes... my suggestion isif someone get disconnected over 1 min, daxian will saythat him/her isnt welcome to the party and send him/her back to kz. (once log back, he/she will be able to accept daxian again) 3.3. wzg has so many \"junk\" weapon skills with 0 perferm. for spells, zhenhuo is probably as strong as a bighammer with the cost of 100 neili and 100 fali while baxian isnt effective at all against high dx char or NPC since baxian's skills are limited (in my option, not sure if they increase with the caster's dx or enchant)qiankun is very nice to have but not as useful as dingshen of fangcun or jin gou zhou of putuo in many cases. besides, if betary from wzg, the dizi will lose all of his taiyi which is the only thing good at wzg... so ...please add at least 1 perform for wzg (maybe requires the user to have all wzg's weapon skills to 50 or 100)Last, thanks to all the wiz for this great MUD!*bow wiz","file_name":"/data/doc/1998/Jul/doc7.16","id":"doc",])
