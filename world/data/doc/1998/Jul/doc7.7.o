His connection to main site sometimes was verylag, so he telnet to our machine and connects to xyj, which isfaster.mint/xina is our best friend too, she was using zmud, but now sheis addicted to onion's enhanced tintin. So she use the same machine.This early morning, it turns out we can only login 3 char from sameip. So we tried to login from another machine from our group.After a while, the cap increased to 4, but now the machines fromsame group are accounted as same ip.After kuer's post, seems one or more wiz thinks the system still not perfect,thus comes new changes: when ur ip has 4 char in, if u d/c, u cannotre-connect. It would be more fun when net lag a while and when wehappen to have 4 quota filled and d/c'ed -- to wiz's eyes.Wizs made this mud and they will have the 1st priority to havefun I think. That was what I believed, and that was why I hadquit xyj for a few months, also that was the reason I quit playingfengyun.Now we trying to make some noise, not meant to offend any players herebut we know the result will. I respect all the wizs' rights to havetheir fun. So when wizs think I shall leave here, I will be glad todo so.(For over half a year, kuer had never made more complainsto wiz, although I knew lots of things had done unfair to him-- directly or indirectly. So I guesskuer finally believes same thing now.)ps: ppl may think kuer made use of all bugs and catch all the goodthings. kuer lost interest to post what was changed by wiz.Maybe these changes are so small, won't be noticed by other players,but i guess the impact on kuer is big -- ofcuz these changes are notagainst kuer -- xyj rule #1: wiz change what they feel like to change.(quoted from one wiz, explaining any changes they made were not toagainst certain player. -- correct me if it is not exactly the samewords)For NPC to fight, kuer kept abandoning hammer and only gain exp frompotential for more than 1000 yrs. He had to fight tianwang, whoseenforce was extremely high (and, from our old, limited experience,too high to be fighting target) -- ofcuz he need to move themtoo. He had spent hrs to pick some NPC with high enuf danshi tofight with, before he starts his robots. He has to guess the NPC'sexp from his speed rate, since some NPC's attack point increasedmore than 10 times without any notice. He betrayed to longgong tofight with dragon hufa, then after a while they are changed to unableto fight with. He tried to fight with bai yuan in penglai, ofcuzchanges made for that immediately. When most players still believefighting as many NPC is best, he find out his speed fighting morethan 4 NPCs were same as, if not slower than, 4 NPCs. (remark: Iguess more than 4 NPC still better than 4 if NPC's danshi not enuf,but I cannot verify this, since changes are frequent and maybeI won't be able to play more chars or post more.)These are only a few things I remember which is related to NPCs only.( a long ps., eh? :)","file_name":"/data/doc/1998/Jul/doc7.7","id":"doc",])
