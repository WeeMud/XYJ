And the speed of generating fruits is faster thanbeing killed.So there is really no need to kill them.Now if the three xings are being killed, it will take a long timefor them to have the first fruit. After that, the speed is the sameas before. So now, if one trying to kill them, it will only make thehplookwaiting time longer and no benefit at all.By the way, the three xings will not give out fruits to the same playerconsequtively, so it is better to share the fruits between players. :)mon","id":"doc",])
