I am happy that I did not spend $7.00+on this in theater.  Still, had I know this films sucksI would have not even rented it.As an actor, Gibson is so-so.  He tried very hard to be funnySometimes he even succeeded.  But most of the times,biteI just feel his pretense seems more like an insult tothe inteligence of the viewers.As far as directing goes, he sucks big time.  I almostfell asleep while watching the battle scenes in 'Brave Heart'.I tried very hard to try to feel the excruciating painWallace is supposed to endure during the finale scene of torturing.I couln't feel any.  I had no admiration for his courage, nor doI hate his enemy for their cruelty.  Indifference was allthat I felt.  As the ropes were tightened gradually and Wallacenear death, I somehow thought the whole scene was very funnyand wanted to laugh.To me, it's a absolute miracle and unsolved mystery thatwill probably remain unsolved for centries  why this filmcan win Oscar for 'Best Picture' and 'Best Director' in 1995.But on second thought, hey, shit happens.I am extremely shocked and disappointed to know that Gibson,with his questionable talent, is going to directa film-adaptation of Ray Bradbury's Sci-Fi novel 'Fahrenheit 451',one of my all-time favorite.bite*sigh2","name":"ÎÄµµ","file_name":"/data/doc/1998/Jul/doc7.106","id":"doc",])
