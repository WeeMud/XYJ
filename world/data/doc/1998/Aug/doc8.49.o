One of the womenin the group was a real curmudgeon, constantly complaining.The bus seats are uncomfortable the food is terrible It's too hot,It's too cold & the accommodations are awful.The group arrived at the site of the famous Blarney Stone.\"Good luck will be following you all your days, if you kiss the BlarneyStone,\" the guide said. \"Unfortunately, it's being cleaned today and so noone will be able to kiss it. Perhaps we can come back tomorrow.\"\"We can't be here tomorrow,\" the nasty woman shouted. \"We have someother boring tour to go on. So I guess we can't kiss the stupid stone.\"\"Well now,\" the guide said, \"it is said that if you kiss someone who haskissed the stone, you'll have the same good fortune.\"\"And I suppose you've kissed the stone,\" the woman scoffed.No, ma'am,\" the frustrated guide said, \"but I've sat on it.","name":"ÎÄµµ","file_name":"/data/doc/1998/Aug/doc8.49","id":"doc",])
