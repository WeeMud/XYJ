This is fair sinceit is their mud. This is not right if the wiz seriously want the mud tobe a good mud. 1+ yr of playing xyj gave me this 1st impression though.  before I came to xyj, i heard there was some wiz snooping two girlswho talking to each other. As I heard, he mailed the snooping to someother male who is kind of related, and the contents of the two girls'talk was quite private, any ppl with good moral won't continue tosnoop even if snooped it by chance.  The snooping seems still be a quite enjoyable thing to wiz. When ipk with jiezhao, there was some wiz snooped, and had great fun, evenstand and chat out after some death. (it is also a good chance forthem to learn how to pk. maybe my self-feeling was too good, but evenif I was a lousy pker, they still can learn sth from snooping, reallearning from pk cost a lot.)  Now with the current pk, i think most wiz are quite excited. Some1really like to see pk, some1 enjoying see the actions during pk, some1make it good chance to make his wiz image better (btw, whenjiezhao was pking other players, I did not see why he did not catchthat chance to improve the wiz image.) If to think over what the wiz did after pk, u see what they areagainst is the unbalanced pk. They want the pk to be exciting for themto watch. To stop pk, they can totally stop it, but i smelled thatwhat they really want is to see kuer got pked, and I expect more changesto make that most possible.  Some wiz did think I left xyj actually do xyj good, btw. I do notknow much of the details of this though. Fy changed my life once, so\"onion\" bring me to xyj to have a break, and my life changed againafter that. From the fact, i should appreciate xyj, but my own feelingwon't let me do so now.--heng*","name":"ÎÄµµ","file_name":"/data/doc/1998/Aug/doc8.36","id":"doc",])
