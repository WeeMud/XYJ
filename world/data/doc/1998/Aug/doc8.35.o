(1)                     Ô×¸¸¶à¶à(Hengha) (Thu Aug  6)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------What I want to say is:1) pk will do harm, if i open i mud, i would make the rule todiscourage pk.   every1 knows pk do hard to the one got pk'ed, but it also do harmto the pker. 1st u have stress, then u get familiar with pk. Jiezhaois the 2nd ppl I pk'ed. (1st is fer) But later when I pk'ed him more and moretimes, when there is interest conflicts with others, seems I becomeless and less willing to solve it in nice way. I just keep silent, andwhen the other part starts to pk me, i do pk back -- quite a naturalbehavior to me now. Before i started pk jiezhao, i guess my reactionshould be different.  one example was elf: when shashou and ganji \"rob\" \"my\" bj guai, i justwarned them, and fained her once and put her into some room with noobvious exit. Later she tried to issue kill on elf, so I ate her.Later amao had some conflicts with me, he is nonn's friends, so heappeared to be rude, i was rude too ofcuz. Later I think he login uuoubian'ed bj guai, made me died of bj guai. I just ate uuou back, and thinkit also might be shashou/ganji who did it, so ate them two too. The most recent pk of elf was my friend, but since i gave them thepasswd, I took all the responsibility.--heng*","name":"ÎÄµµ","file_name":"/data/doc/1998/Aug/doc8.35","id":"doc",])
