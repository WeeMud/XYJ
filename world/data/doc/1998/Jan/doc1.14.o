Whenever her lover comes over, sheputs her nine year old son in the closet.  One day the woman hears a car inthe  driveway and puts her lover in the closet, as well.Inside the closet, the  little boy says, \"It's dark in here,isn't it?\"\"Yes it is,\" the man replies.\"You wanna buy a baseball?\" the little boy asks.\"No thanks,\" the man replies.\"I think you do want to buy a baseball,\" the little extortionist continues.\"OK. How much?\" the man replies after considering the position he is in.\"Twenty-five dollars,\" the little boy replies.\"TWENTY-FIVE DOLLARS?!\" the man repeats incredulously, but complies toprotect his hidden position.The following week, the lover is visiting the woman again when she hears acar in the driveway and, again, places her lover in the closet with herlittle boy.\"It's dark in here, isn't it?\" the boy starts off.\"Yes it is,\" replies the man.\"Wanna buy a baseball glove?\" the little boy asks.\"OK. How much?\" the hiding lover responds, acknowledging his disadvantage.\"Fifty dollars,\" the boy replies and the transaction is completed.The next weekend, the little boy's father says \"Hey, son. Go get your balland glove and we'll play some catch.\"\"I can't. I sold them,\" replies the little boy.\"How much did you get for them?\" asks the father, expecting to hear theprofit in terms of lizards and candy.\"Seventy-five dollars,\" the little boy says.\"SEVENTY-FIVE DOLLARS?! That's thievery! I'm taking you to the church rightnow.  You must confess your sin and ask for forgiveness\", the fatherexplains as he hauls the child away.At the church, the little boy goes into the confessional, draws thecurtain, sits down, and says \"It's dark in here, isn't it?\"\"Don't you start that in here,\" the priest says.","file_name":"/data/doc/1998/Jan/doc1.14",])
