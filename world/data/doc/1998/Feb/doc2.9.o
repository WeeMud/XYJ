Many NPCswere designed for mid hands to fight or NK to gain 道行 and  潜能.Let me repeat here:  - they are often NOT highly enforced;  - they are ranging from 100yr to 1000 yr;  - they are often better and give even faster 道行/潜能 than bajiao guai;  - they are so many that the players should never have shortage;If you still doubt about them, then you really have to go to try them.Besides in the post, I only listed a small amount of them. There aremore NPCs waiting for you in this MUD.[65] re: 稀有动物                             雪豹(Snowcat)(Sat Feb  7)----------------------------------------------------------------------there are more NPCs in this mud. they have been waiting for youthere for a long time. but so far seldom players go to visit them.i can give you some hints here. for example:- 草头神: in meishan, can split into multiple npcs.there are 2 places where you can find them- 水蛭精: in pansi, can split into multiple npcs.there are 2 places where you ca^@n find them- 小童 (黑鼠怪, 黄犰怪, ..., 水獾怪): in xiaoxitian, they don'tsplit but are grouped together.there are 3 places where you can find them- 小妖: in yalong mountain (near pingding), can't split butalways grouped together as 3 or 4,there are 5 places where you can find them.and there are many more like that, please go to try. compared tothem, bajiao guais are less attractive. check the map \"help map-qujing\",there are a lot of npcs, many even hidden. for example, 50% of 碗子山in baoxiang have hidden who can jump out as group npcs. i saw 4 or 5mid/high hands go to 碗子山 to fight them regularly.","file_name":"/data/doc/1998/Feb/doc2.9","id":"doc","name":"文档",])
