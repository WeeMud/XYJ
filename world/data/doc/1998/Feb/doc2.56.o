However, do inform them that you will not havetime to grade it until after you complete your Ph.D. DISRUPTIVE STUDENTS1.If students will not stop talking when the class period begins,announce that there will be a quiz the following day on today'slecture. Then leave. 2.If your students are prone to reading the school paper in class, try taking out a full page ad in the paper informing them that they are going to flunk your class. LECTURES 1.In the event that you are unprepared for a lecture, be sure to use the class time to stress to the class the importance of keeping up with the readings. In fact, spend most of the class time stressing this.2.When the time comes to lecture on a subject you know nothing about,the art of controlled digression is invaluable. Here, you try toincite unrelated questions from the class which you answer at length.Then at the end of class you scold them for digressing and tell themthey'll just have to get the material from the book. GRADING1.Always use a fire engine red felt-tip marker with a 1/2 inch tip tograde papers. Position your comments strategically so that they spell\"DUMB\" when seen from a distance.2.You may grade assignments however you like. Here is a guide toquick and easy grading: 20 % Name 20 % Penmanship 50 % Homework is stapled together 10 % The work itself Warning: Be prepared for a 60% class average. GRADING ERRORS1.If student A approaches you complaining that an answer on theirexam was marked incorrect but was marked correct on student B's exam,promptly mark student B's answer incorrect as well. This will redirectthe heat from you onto student A. EXTRA CREDIT1.If students request extra credit to make up for the homework theydidn't turn in, be sure to make the opportunity available to them.Some good extra credit problems are:   Solve the dining philosophers problem, using semaphores.   Write a C compiler for the Commodore 64.   Translate Moby Dick into ASCII-8 code with a leftmost odd parity      bit.   Design a replacement for the 80486 chip.   Build a File Allocation Table (FAT) out of balsa wood.2.You may also wish to tell the student that they can do extra creditwork while you decide whether to accept it. When the student turns inthe work, decide against it. CHEATING1.When it is obvious to you that several people have copied eachothers homework, grade one person's work on a separate sheet ofpaper, then photocopy your comments onto everyone else's homework.2.Should you have very skilled cheaters in your class, try givingincorrect information during your lectures. This should result inincorrect answers on exams. Examples that have proven effective atthis technique include:   The three components of a computer system are Larry, Moe, and Curly.   The only possible digits in the binary system are 0, 1, and 2.   The three components of the CPU are the ALU, REGISTERS, and cheap      bathroom lighting fixtures.   The microphone is an output device.   \"Booting\" the computer involves waving a large magnet over your hard      drive for 60 seconds.   MS-DOS is the operating system for the CRAY Y-MP.   When preparing to purchase a new computer system running Windows,      you should make sure it has at least 128,000 bytes of main memory.   Protocols include saluting your computer and calling the mouse      \"sir\".   CPU stands for Ceramic Public Urinal.","file_name":"/data/doc/1998/Feb/doc2.56","id":"doc",])
