But i asure you guys that shashou will not be apker, no matter it is controlled by me or that guy.*hohoand the other reason is that if we want to create new charsin the holidays, and want to make them grow rapidly, this charwill be greatly helpful. But i am afraid some1 will not let shashouappear in xyj, for example, xiii.maybe you don't know, xiii was killed by hundian yao in wdd 3 or 4 days ago.and it is shashou who applied a chong on xiii and then carry herinto wdd, and caused the death of xiii. *bigman shashou*yaxiii said she(he?) will play a big game with me(not sure with meor all the players). 12 is too powerful lah. if he will pk, all the players have to stay in kezhan chatting.*addoil 12*grinok, again, simply, shashou stop pk lah!!!!!*sigh*idle…± ÷",])
