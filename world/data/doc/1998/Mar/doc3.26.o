The tao resouce is open for every player. I just want my share.I tried to use KeShui Chong. but the robot didn't fall asleep. *faint*poor6 gold ah :(I thought about using cast thunder on her, but I was afraid the cast might kill her. I accused her, but the system told me should be more players to accuse her.*faintPlease give me some suggestion.I know some players may not care of this. please post what you thinkit is right.",])
