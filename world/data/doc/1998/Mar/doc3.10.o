Monk/nun will have a chance to choose one lifetime partner so that they maycooperate sometimes. They can also learn from each other since marriage is strictly not allowed :) See Huian for details.2. There is a new skill (Huoyun-qiang) designed for Honghaier, and some other NPC also learn some skills on it. Go check your master.3. A perform on lunhui-zhang and huoyun-qiang is added. This need the couple of partners to groupfight your opponents: one use lunhui-zhang ans one use huoyun-qiang. The command is: perform qifei.4. A new cast is added for buddhism. You need a jinguzhou to cast it. Ask Lu Dongbin who is around the center of zizhulin for details. Note: be careful, you may lost your way when entering zizhulin. Command: cast jinguzhou.All those are still under construction. If you have any questions/comments, feel free to let us know. Also bug reports are high apprecited. --Dream","file_name":"/data/doc/1998/Mar/doc3.10","name":"ÎÄµµ","id":"doc",])
