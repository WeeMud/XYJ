This time he comes back not for fun, but forto kill jiezhao and all his dummy, to kick all of them outof XYJ. Now that jiezhao thinks Pk is fun, he will getmuch more fun than he experts. Now that wizs can do nothingto it, sigma will do it all by himself. When that day comes,everyone will know who is sigma. That's the promise.sigm is the first char in xyj with higher Dingli. When he is60 yeasr, he gets 300 dx and 1200 neili and fali. When he waskilled by jiezhao, he tried to pass wudidong and again was killed there twice. It seems impossible to revenge by sigma,so he suicides. This time he will be more professional.Hopefully that day will not too long.Some one says jiezhao was done the same thing by God then. Is this the right reason for him to do the same thing to otherplayers? If this continues, when is the end? Every one can dothe same thing to the players who is lower than himself ifhe is done the same thing by others. Then what is the XYJ?Have fun and have good time.","file_name":"/data/doc/1998/Apr/doc4.63","name":"ÎÄµµ","id":"doc",])
