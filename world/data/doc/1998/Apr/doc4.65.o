Everyone you meet, everythingyou see, every idea you had, it'a all real. You don't have todeny it.But like everyone said, \"play it on your own risk\". Mud is notfor everyone, won't give positive feeling to everyone.Like in what you said \"real life\", someone drink, someone don't.someone smoke, someone don't. someone rich, someone poor, someonehappy, someone sad. Something in real life will make you happy and health.Something in \"real life\" will make you even worse.Depend on how you regard it.","file_name":"/data/doc/1998/Apr/doc4.65","name":"文档","id":"doc",])
