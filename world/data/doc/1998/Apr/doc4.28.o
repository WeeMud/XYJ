So let's focus on thegame, no personal attacks pls.I think pxl gave good reasons for what he didIt is good for sgzl not to kill the particular NPCwhen they are doing quests, or you might set the robotto kill the NPC right before refreshing (say 1 min).Making money in xyj is very difficult(may be i did not get the right way to do so), running robot is understanable( i personally run tour to get gold for improve my fy(11)).But i think it should not make other person inconvenient.Again, XYJ is a place for fun. Some people are more serious about it, some people are not. Some people will rememberevery single good thing and bad thing happened to them,some one will not. The bottom line is that it is noof other person's business. Let us respect other people'smud style and resolve conflicts in a mud way  -- discuss,fight, pk, -- but no personal attacks pls.chat* addoil",])
