Which do you want to hear first?\"Fearing the worse, Mr. Wilkens said, \"Give me the bad news first.\"So the policeman said, \"I'm sorry to tell you sir, but this morning wefound your wife's body in San Francisco Bay.\"\"Oh my god!,\" said Mr. Wilkens, overcome by emotion. Then, rememberingwhat the policeman had said, he asked, \"What's the good news?\"\"Well,\" said the policeman, \"When we pulled her up she had twofive-pound lobsters and a dozen good size Dungeoness crabs on her.\"\"If that's the good news than what's the great news?!\", Mr. Wilkensdemanded.The policeman said, \"We're going to pull her up again tomorrowmorning.\"",])
